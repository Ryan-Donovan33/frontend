Features

- What features are required for your minimum viable product?
1. An on-boarding process for parents
 2. Ability to easily create a food entry (including date, food category of fruit, vegetable, whole grains, meat, dairy, fats and oils, and treats (or whatever else you want)
 3. Ability to easily edit / delete a food entry
 4. Display page of daily/weekly/monthly food intake based on category.
- What features may you wish to put in a future release?
          Create an avatar that updates to different phases based on the food intake ( something like happy if fruitIntake>3)
 Allow the parent to add multiple children with different eating logs and characters to their account. Ability for a second parent to log in with a different account and have access to same kids (shared eating logs).
Social interactions with other children (Badges, evolving, trading)

- What do the top 3 similar apps do for their users?
Allow their users to fill accomplish when reaching certain achievements or skills.

For Data Scientists


- Describe the Established data source with at least rough data able to be provided on day 1. 
- You can gather information about the data set you’ll be working with from the project description. Be sure to collaborate with your PM, and your Backend Architect to chat about the resources you have.
- Write a description for what the DS problem is (what uncertainty/prediction are we trying to do here? Sentiment analysis? Why is this a useful solution to a problem?)
- A target (e.g. JSON format or such) for output that DS students can deliver to web/other students for them to ingest and use in the app

Target Audience

- Who is your target audience? Be specific. Parents with children who need help/ motivation to eat.
- What feedback have you gotten from potential users?
- Have you validated the problem and your solution with your target audience? How?

Research

- Research thoroughly before writing a single line of code. Solidify the features of your app conceptually before implementation. Spend the weekend researching so you can hit the ground running on Monday.
Prototype Key Feature(s)

- This is the “bread and butter” of the app, this is what makes your app yours. Calculate how long it takes to implement these features and triple the time estimated. That way you’ll have plenty of time to finish. It is preferred to drop features and spend more time working on your MVP features if needed.
